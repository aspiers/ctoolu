Ctoolu (Clipboard Tool, Universal, pronounced "cthulhu") matches
patterns in the clipboard text and pops up menus to execute actions.
It is inspired by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klipper but aims to be
more modular in its configuration.

Get it:
https://github.com/mvidner/ctoolu

Installation:
  sudo rake install
or
  rake install_user
It will install clipboard-relay on the session D-Bus and set up ctoolu for
session autostart.
FIXME it will overwrite the configuration file if it is already installed.

Requirements:
- ruby-gtk2
- ruby-dbus

Geting the requirements on openSUSE:
  V=`sed -n '/VERSION *= */s///;T;p' /etc/SuSE-release`
  sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/ruby:/extensions/openSUSE_$V rubyext
  sudo zypper in ruby-gtk2 rubygem-ruby-dbus
